Social Media become increasingly important for historical scholarship to reconstruct events, but also analyse current social movements and discursive negotiations. However, the dependence on private platforms and third parties leads to substantial challenges for (historical) research regarding the collection, archiving and analysis of content. This is especially true for the audiovisual platforms Instagram and TikTok. This text aims to both highlight existing difficulties and propose possible approaches for archiving and analysing social media data. Due to the volatile nature of social media, these concepts cannot be considered universally applicable. However, it is clear that further discussions within the discipline as well as interdisciplinary cooperation and initiatives are needed to deal with the challenges.
